Replace the Skills “pipeline” section with a new premium animated Skills Showcase using Framer Motion (NO looping/marquee/pipeline scroll). The current pipeline keeps looping and skills keep “coming and going”. I want to completely remove the pipeline logic and use a different animation layout that looks premium and stable.

Repo: Next.js (pages router) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion.
IMPORTANT:
- Remove ALL pipeline/marquee/autoplay logic (no infinite x-translation, no repeat Infinity, no duplicated arrays).
- The Skills section must stay stable (skills always visible).
- Keep the rest of the site unchanged (navigation, sections, backgrounds, projects, etc.).

========================================================
A) CURRENT PROBLEM
========================================================
- I can see the pipeline lines, but skills are still in a constant loop.
- Skills keep moving in/out (marquee behavior) — this is the bug I want gone.
- Instead of fixing pipeline again, REPLACE the Skills section with a different animation system.

========================================================
B) NEW TARGET: “SKILLS SHOWCASE” (STABLE + PREMIUM)
========================================================
Create a Skills section that is:
- visually attractive and engineered
- stable (no continuous movement across the screen)
- interactive (hover + click)
- uses Framer Motion micro-interactions only (fade/slide/scale/tilt/glow)
- optional subtle background particles behind skills (very light)

I want one of these two layouts (choose the best):
OPTION 1 (preferred): “Orbit + Focus”
- A central featured skill card (auto-rotates every 4–6 seconds OR changes only when user clicks).
- Around it, 8–12 skill chips placed in a circle/orbit.
- Hovering a chip highlights it (glow + lift).
- Clicking a chip sets it as the focused skill in the center (with smooth transition).
- Orbit can have a very slow subtle rotation ONLY if it does NOT look like looping content coming/going (keep orbit rotation extremely subtle, or stop rotation completely and just animate on selection).

OPTION 2: “Interactive Skills Grid”
- Premium glass grid of skill cards (2 rows).
- On hover: glow + scale + slight tilt (CSS transform).
- On click: expands into a detail panel/modal (reuse existing modal if available).
- Add staggered entrance on scroll (Framer Motion whileInView).

========================================================
C) CONTENT (resume-aligned skills)
========================================================
Use these skill groups (do not invent random skills):
DevOps/Cloud:
- Git, Jenkins, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/Azure/GCP
Full Stack:
- React + TypeScript, Node.js + Express, Spring Boot, Postgres/MySQL, Redis
AI:
- OpenAI/ChatGPT API, AWS Bedrock, NLP (only if already in my resume/project content)

Each skill should have:
- label
- icon (existing icons ok)
- short proof tag (optional) like “CI/CD”, “Microservices”, “Caching”, “Cloud”, “API”, etc.

========================================================
D) IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
========================================================
1) DELETE pipeline loop logic:
- In Skills component, remove:
  - setInterval / requestAnimationFrame loops
  - Framer Motion repeat: Infinity animations
  - duplicated skills arrays used for looping
  - CSS marquee infinite keyframes
- Remove connector line + pipeline energy movement if it’s tied to loop behavior.

2) Build new Skills component:
- Create: components/SkillsShowcase.js
- Replace the Skills section usage in pages/index.js with <SkillsShowcase />
- Keep section heading text “Skills Playground” (or rename to “Skills Showcase” if better).

3) Add Framer Motion animations (stable):
- Entrance: stagger children, fade+slide up whileInView
- Hover: scale 1.05 + glow shadow + slight tilt
- Click: animate selected skill into center (layoutId animation preferred if using Orbit layout)

4) Modal/details:
- If I already have skill modal logic, reuse it:
  - clicking a skill opens the same modal
  - modal close works (X, ESC, outside click)
- If not, implement a lightweight detail modal with glass background.

5) Performance + no overflow:
- Ensure no horizontal scrollbar.
- Ensure nothing moves continuously across viewport like a marquee.
- Any subtle motion must be low amplitude and not appear like looping content.

========================================================
E) DELIVERABLE
========================================================
✅ Skills section no longer loops endlessly  
✅ Skills always visible and stable  
✅ Looks premium using Framer Motion micro-interactions  
✅ Hover/click interactions feel modern  
✅ No horizontal overflow / no scrollbars added  
✅ Only Skills section changed; rest of site remains unchanged  

Start by removing the pipeline loop code, then implement SkillsShowcase using OPTION 1 (Orbit + Focus). If OPTION 1 becomes too complex, fallback to OPTION 2 (Interactive Skills Grid) but keep it premium.
