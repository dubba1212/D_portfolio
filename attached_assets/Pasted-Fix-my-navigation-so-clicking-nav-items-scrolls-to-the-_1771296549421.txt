Fix my navigation so clicking nav items scrolls to the correct section (single-page portfolio).

CURRENT BUG:
- Navbar clicks do nothing / don’t scroll to sections.

GOALS:
- Keep a single page layout (sections stacked vertically).
- Clicking nav item must smoothly scroll to the section (Home/About/Skills/Work/Testimonials/Contact).
- Must work on desktop + mobile.
- Must work even when a modal is open (modal should close first, then scroll).
- Do NOT break existing animations.

TASKS:
1) Inspect current navbar implementation:
   - Find the component for navbar / side navigation.
   - Identify link targets used (e.g., "/about" vs "#about").
   - If it uses Next <Link>, ensure it supports hash anchors properly.

2) Ensure each section has a correct id:
   - <section id="home">, <section id="about">, <section id="skills">, <section id="work">, <section id="testimonials">, <section id="contact">
   - Confirm these ids match the nav targets EXACTLY.

3) Implement reliable smooth scroll behavior:
   - When clicking a nav item, prevent default link behavior.
   - Use document.getElementById(targetId)?.scrollIntoView({ behavior: "smooth", block: "start" }).
   - Update URL hash using history.pushState(null, "", `#${targetId}`) without reloading.

4) Fix clickability issues:
   - Ensure navbar buttons/links have proper z-index and pointer-events.
   - Ensure any overlay/particles/decor layers use pointer-events: none.
   - If a full-screen overlay exists, confirm it is not blocking clicks when it shouldn’t.

5) Fix nested scroll container issues:
   - Search for CSS like ".page { overflow-y: scroll }" or body/html scroll locks.
   - Ensure the page scroll container is the window (html/body), not a nested div.
   - Remove/adjust overflow-y on wrappers if it prevents anchor scrolling.
   - Keep overflow-x hidden to prevent horizontal scrollbars.

6) If using Next.js Link:
   - For section scroll, use <a href="#about"> with onClick handler.
   - Or use next/router and router.push("#about", undefined, { shallow: true }) + scrollIntoView.
   - Ensure it doesn’t navigate to a non-existent route.

7) When a skill modal/panel is open:
   - On nav click, close the modal first (setSelectedSkill(null)), then scroll after a short requestAnimationFrame (or setTimeout 0).

DELIVERABLE:
- Nav items smoothly scroll to correct sections.
- Add a small helper function: scrollToSection(id).
- List files changed.

Start by locating the navbar component and checking its href targets. Then implement the scroll helper and wire it to each nav item click.
