Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: In GUIDED MODE, when the user completes the LAST required connection, show an auto “Completion Dock Terminal” summary (like scenario plan terminal) so the user gets a clear payoff: what they connected + what it enables them to build.

CURRENT STATE (problem)
- Guided Mode works well: connect a module to an Output Stream, next stage unlocks.
- But after the final stage connection, NOTHING happens (no feedback, no summary).
- This feels disappointing.

TARGET UX
- When Guided Mode reaches completion (all required stages connected):
  1) Automatically open a dock terminal (same style as your existing terminal UI).
  2) Terminal shows a “GUIDED MODE SUMMARY”:
     - FRONTEND: connected modules (names)
     - BACKEND: connected modules (names)
     - INFRASTRUCTURE: connected modules (names)
     - AI/LLM: connected modules (names)
  3) Show a “You can build” line:
     - Based on the connected outputs, pick ONE suggested build result (ex: “AI Chatbot”, “SaaS Dashboard”, “Microservices Platform”, “RAG Search”, “CI/CD Pipeline”, “Data Pipeline”).
     - If there is already an active scenario, align the suggestion to it.
     - If no scenario selected, infer from outputs connected:
         - ChatGPT Tools / Bedrock Apps => “AI Chatbot”
         - RAG Pipelines => “AI Search (RAG)”
         - Dashboards / Performance UI => “SaaS Dashboard”
         - Microservices / REST APIs => “Microservices Platform”
         - CI/CD Pipelines / IaC => “CI/CD Pipeline”
         - Data Pipeline outputs => “Data Pipeline”
  4) Add a small CTA row (optional but clean):
     - “Copy Summary” button (copies summary text)
     - “Reset Guided Mode” button (clears guided progress and closes terminal)
- Terminal must NOT overlap the center skills cards.
- Terminal must only appear automatically at guided completion; otherwise it remains as current behavior.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Detect Guided Mode Completion
- Identify the guided mode progression state currently used (ex: connectedStages, completedSteps, unlockedIndex, connectionsMap).
- Completion condition: all required guided steps/stages are connected.
- Trigger completion only once per run:
  - if guidedCompleted flag is false -> set true and open terminal
  - avoid re-triggering on rerenders

2) Capture “Connected Modules” by Category
- Track connections in a structured way:
  - connectedByCategory = { frontend: [], backend: [], infrastructure: [], ai: [] }
- When a module is connected to an output stream, store it under the category it belongs to.
- If the module already exists, do not duplicate.

3) Completion Terminal (Dock)
- Use the same terminal component style and layout as your existing dock terminal:
  - dark glass panel, red accent title, close X, Framer Motion slide/fade.
- Title example:
  - “GUIDED MODE: SYSTEM BUILD COMPLETE”
- Body format:
  - FRONTEND: React/TS, UI Perf, …
  - BACKEND: Node API, Spring Boot, Auth/JWT, …
  - INFRA: Docker, K8s, Terraform, Jenkins, AWS/GCP, …
  - AI/LLM: OpenAI API, Bedrock, RAG Pipeline, NLP Engine, …
- Also show:
  - “RESULT: You can build → <Suggested App>”
  - 1-line explanation under result (short, not long)

4) Terminal Behavior
- Auto opens when guided completes.
- Close X hides terminal but keeps guidedCompleted state true.
- Reset guided mode clears:
  - guidedCompleted false
  - unlocked stage resets to start
  - all guided connections cleared
  - terminal closed

5) Layout Guarantee (No overlap)
- Dock must be inside the center board layout, in a bottom row (grid/flex).
- Skills/cards grid stays above it and can scroll if needed.
- Do NOT use absolute bottom positioning for this terminal.

FILES / IMPLEMENTATION
- Update the guided mode logic where connections are handled (drag-to-connect drop handler).
- Update the terminal/dock component to support a “guidedSummary” mode view.
- Add helper function inferBuildResultFromOutputs(connectedOutputs, activeScenario) to choose suggested build.

DELIVER
- Implement completion detection + summary tracking + guided completion terminal.
- List files changed and brief notes on what each change did.
