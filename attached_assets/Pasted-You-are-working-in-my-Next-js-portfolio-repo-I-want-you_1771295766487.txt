You are working in my Next.js portfolio repo. I want you to implement a premium, interactive “Skills Playground” section (replace my current “Core Expertise” cards) that showcases my Software Engineer / Full-Stack / AI skills with proof + project linkage.

========================
GOALS (must match)
========================
1) Replace the current “Core Expertise” section with an interactive “Skills Playground”.
2) Showcase these skills (minimum):
   - Docker
   - Kubernetes
   - React
   - Postgres
   - Node.js
   - Git
   - AWS
3) The section must feel premium (engineered, not template):
   - subtle glow, hover micro-interactions, smooth easing
   - scroll-based entrance animation (fade/slide)
   - consistent spacing and typography hierarchy
4) Make the skills interactive:
   - click a skill to open details (right-side panel on desktop, bottom sheet/modal on mobile)
   - show proof metrics from my resume (uptime, release speed, performance, data scale)
   - show “Projects using this skill” chips that filter/highlight my Projects carousel (Work/Portfolio section)
5) Keep site single-page scroll + anchors working. Don’t break smooth scrolling.

========================
RESUME PROOF CONTENT (use these lines verbatim or tightly paraphrased)
========================
Use these proof points per skill, derived from my resume: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

- Kubernetes: “Maintained 99.8% uptime for enterprise retail microservices serving 1,000+ daily users.”
- Docker + CI/CD: “Reduced release cycles from 2 hours to 15 minutes with Jenkins + Docker, zero-downtime deployments.”
- React: “Built full-stack features with React + TypeScript; improved component performance + state management.”
- Postgres: “Improved backend performance 40% via PostgreSQL query optimization; also 2.5s → 1.0s (60%) via tuning/indexing.”
- Node.js: “Built pipelines handling ~2TB/month enabling real-time analytics dashboards.”
- AWS: “Reduced deployment time by 60% and achieved 99.9% uptime with load balancing + autoscaling (CloudMart).”
- Git (process): “Delivered 15+ production features; improved delivery velocity by 30% via Agile + code reviews.”

Also highlight AI projects:
- “AI Appointment Scheduler using ChatGPT API + Google Calendar/Docs via GCP APIs.”
- “CloudMart AI recommendations using OpenAI GPT + AWS Bedrock.”

========================
PLAYGROUND DESIGN (choose this default implementation)
========================
Implement the “Pipeline Playground” as the signature interaction:
Git → Docker → CI/CD → Kubernetes → AWS → Postgres → Node.js → React (or React before Node.js if layout demands)

Interaction requirements:
- Each stage is a clickable chip/node with icon + label.
- On hover: glow + slight scale + smooth transition.
- On click: open detail panel with:
  - Title + short “What I do”
  - Proof metric (badge)
  - 2-3 bullets of real responsibilities
  - “Projects using this” chips (clicking filters my Projects carousel)
- Add subtle animated “flow” along the pipeline (small moving dots/line), tasteful and performant.

Mobile:
- Pipeline becomes vertical or wraps into 2 rows.
- Detail panel becomes bottom sheet/modal.

========================
PROJECT LINKING (very important)
========================
Create a clean mapping from skills → projects.
At minimum support these projects:
- Walmart Microservices / Retail Platform
- Version Full-stack Modernization
- E-commerce (Django + React)
- AI Appointment Scheduler
- CloudMart (AI + AWS Bedrock)

When a user clicks a skill, the “Projects using this” chips should:
- Scroll to the Work/Portfolio section (anchor)
- Apply filter to show only matching projects in the Projects carousel
- If my carousel is currently not filterable, update it so it can filter by tags/skills.
- Include a “Clear filter” control.

========================
FILES / IMPLEMENTATION
========================
1) Create a new component: components/SkillsPlayground.js
2) Create a data file: data/skillsPlaygroundData.js containing:
   - skills array (id, label, icon, proofBadge, description, bullets, tags, linkedProjects)
   - projects array (id, title, description, image, tags, links)
3) Create a reusable UI component for detail panel:
   - components/SkillDetailPanel.js (desktop side panel + mobile bottom sheet behavior)
4) Update the page to replace the old Core Expertise section:
   - Find where “Core Expertise” is rendered and replace it with <SkillsPlayground />
5) Integrate filtering with Projects carousel:
   - Update Work/Portfolio carousel component so it accepts a “selectedSkill” filter or “selectedTags”
   - Cards should show overlay: title + short description + tech chips (already requested earlier)
6) Styling:
   - Use Tailwind classes consistent with existing theme (dark purple + red accent #f13024)
   - Add premium micro-interactions (glow/shadow/scale)
   - Add scroll entrance animations via Framer Motion
7) Performance + overflow:
   - No horizontal overflow / no bottom scrollbar
   - Keep smooth scrolling and anchors working
   - Ensure pointer-events none for decorative layers if used

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
- Implement the full Skills Playground + detail panel + project filtering integration.
- After implementing, list:
  - files created/modified
  - where to update project images/links
  - how to add a new skill or project entry
- Do NOT remove existing sections; only replace Core Expertise with this new section.
- Ensure everything works on desktop + mobile.

Start now by scanning the repo for the existing Core Expertise section and current Projects carousel implementation. Then implement the new components and wire the filter state from SkillsPlayground → Projects section (via props, context, or top-level state).
