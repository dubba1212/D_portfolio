Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: Move the MODULE_DATA_STREAM terminal (normal mode) from bottom dock into the CENTER board — same UX style as Scenario Plan terminal. Keep scenario mode exactly as it is.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- In normal mode (System Nodes: Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure/AI), when I click a module skill (ex: Terraform), the terminal opens at the bottom of the page as a dock.
- I do NOT want the bottom dock behavior in normal mode.
- I want the terminal to appear like the Scenario session: visually attached to the center board and not “below everything”.

TARGET UX:
A) Scenario mode:
- Do NOT change anything. Scenario plan + scenario modules are already perfect.

B) Normal mode:
- When user selects a System Node -> center board shows that category’s module cards (unchanged).
- When user clicks a module card -> show MODULE_DATA_STREAM terminal INSIDE the center board container (embedded panel), not as a full width bottom dock.
- The embedded terminal should match the “Scenario Plan terminal” layout style:
  - anchored inside the board at the bottom area
  - no overlap with modules
  - board becomes a 2-row layout:
    1) module grid area
    2) embedded terminal panel area
- If no module selected -> embedded terminal is hidden and board returns to full height modules grid.

LAYOUT REQUIREMENTS (NO OVERLAP):
- Use a flex/column layout inside the board:
  - top: modules list/grid (scrollable if needed)
  - bottom: terminal panel (fixed height)
- Ensure module cards remain visible and not hidden behind the terminal.
- If content overflows, only the modules area scrolls (terminal stays visible).

STATE / LOGIC REQUIREMENTS:
- Keep existing selectedCategory behavior.
- Keep existing selectedModule behavior.
- Terminal should open ONLY when selectedModule is set.
- Terminal should close when:
  - user clicks “X”
  - user switches category (Frontend -> Backend etc)
  - user clears scenario (if scenario impacts module selection)
- Scenario terminal logic remains separate and unchanged.

ANIMATION:
- Add Framer Motion smooth transitions for the embedded module terminal:
  - slide up + fade in when a module is clicked
  - slide down + fade out on close
- Maintain the same premium glassmorphism style.

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS:
1) Identify current bottom dock component (likely a fixed positioned terminal container).
2) Refactor so normal-mode module terminal renders inside the center board component instead of fixed bottom.
3) Keep scenario terminal logic as-is.
4) Ensure no horizontal overflow and responsiveness stays intact.

DELIVERABLE:
- List files changed.
- Provide exact code edits.
- Confirm: Normal mode terminal is embedded into board; scenario mode unchanged.
