Update my “Skills Playground” UI behavior.

CURRENT ISSUE:
- Clicking a skill opens a right-side panel/drawer.
- I want a unique overlay that doesn’t force users to look to the side.
- My close arrow button currently does NOT close the panel.

TARGET UI:
- Replace the right-side drawer with a centered “glass spotlight” modal overlay.
- The rest of the page (skills pipeline + portfolio) must remain visible behind it.
- The modal must be semi-transparent (glass effect) but fully readable.
- The modal must be easy to close and must close properly.

CLOSE BEHAVIOR (must implement all):
1) Clicking the back arrow inside modal closes.
2) Clicking the X button closes.
3) Pressing ESC closes.
4) Clicking outside the modal (on backdrop) closes.
5) When modal is open, prevent background scroll (lock body scroll) but keep page visible.

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Dark purple theme + red accent (#f13024)
- Glassmorphism:
  - background: rgba(20, 18, 35, 0.55) or similar
  - border: 1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.10)
  - backdrop-blur
- Add a smooth enter/exit animation (Framer Motion):
  - backdrop fade in/out
  - modal scales in slightly + fades in (spring or ease)
- Make text readable:
  - use stronger contrast for headings
  - use slightly brighter white for body
- On mobile:
  - use bottom-sheet style modal (full width, rounded top corners)
  - same close methods (X, arrow, outside click, ESC if supported)

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
- Identify where the current skill detail panel is implemented (SkillDetailPanel or similar).
- Replace it with a modal overlay component (SkillSpotlightModal).
- The arrow button MUST call onClose (setSelectedSkill(null) or setOpen(false)).
- Ensure pointer-events and z-index allow clicking close buttons.
- Keep the portfolio section visible behind the modal.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the new modal overlay.
- Confirm arrow close works.
- List files changed.

Start by scanning components used in SkillsPlayground (SkillDetailPanel/SkillsPlayground files) and refactor accordingly.
