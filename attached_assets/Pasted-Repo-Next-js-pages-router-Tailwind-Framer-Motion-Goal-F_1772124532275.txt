Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: FIX Skills Playground scenario behavior + restore correct category skills + move Scenario Plan into CENTER board (NOT bottom dock). Keep current UI style.

CONTEXT (CURRENT PROBLEMS):
- When I click any System Node (Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure/AI), it shows the SAME skills for all categories (wrong).
- When I click a scenario, it does NOT show the required skills for that scenario (wrong).
- Scenario Plan terminal auto-opens in the bottom dock and overlaps / hides skills. I DON’T want this behavior.
- I want the PREVIOUS pattern: center board shows the scenario skills + a small inline terminal inside the center board (no overlap), while the bottom dock should NOT auto-open for scenarios.
- I want scenario toggle behavior: clicking the same scenario again should deselect it (or CLEAR SCENARIO does it).

TARGET UX (MUST MATCH):
A) Normal mode (NO scenario active):
- Left: System Nodes (Frontend/Backend/Infrastructure/AI) work normally.
- Center: shows ONLY the selected category’s modules (correct modules for that category).
- Bottom terminal: appears ONLY when user clicks a specific module skill (not on category click, not on scenario click).

B) Scenario mode (scenario active):
- Center board switches into a 2x2 grouped layout inside the board:
  - FRONTEND group (top-left)
  - BACKEND group (top-right)
  - INFRASTRUCTURE group (bottom-left)
  - AI/LLM group (bottom-right)
- In each group show the specific modules required by that scenario (only those modules).
- BELOW those grouped modules (still inside the center board), show a SMALL inline “Scenario Plan Terminal” panel (like your current terminal styling but smaller) with:
  - SCENARIO_PLAN: <scenario name>
  - bullet list of FRONTEND/BACKEND/INFRA/AI selected skills
  - optional “VIEW MATCHING REPO” button (ONLY if scenario has a matched repo link)
- DO NOT open the large bottom terminal dock for scenario clicks.
- Bottom dock should stay closed unless user clicks a module skill card.

C) Scenario toggle / clear:
- If user clicks the currently active scenario again => DESELECT scenario and return to normal mode.
- Clicking CLEAR SCENARIO button also does the same reset.
- When scenario deselects:
  - activeScenarioId = null
  - scenarioPlan cleared
  - center board returns to normal category view
  - scenario inline terminal disappears
  - module-selected bottom dock closes IF it was opened by scenario context

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS:
1) FIX DATA STRUCTURE:
- Create / use a single source of truth for skills per category:
  - categories: frontend, backend, infrastructure, ai
  - each category has its own module list (NO CROSS-CATEGORY duplication)
- Ensure system node click reads only from the correct category list.

2) FIX SCENARIO SYSTEM:
- Store scenarios in a dedicated file:
  - /data/scenarios.js (or /data/scenarios.ts)
  - Each scenario includes:
    - id, label
    - requiredModules: { frontend: [], backend: [], infrastructure: [], ai: [] }
    - outputs: [] (optional)
    - matchingRepoUrl: "" (optional)
- When scenario active, the center board uses requiredModules, not the normal category list.

3) UI LAYOUT (NO OVERLAP):
- The scenario plan terminal must be INSIDE the center board container and must not cover the modules:
  - Use a board layout like:
    - top: grouped modules grid
    - bottom: inline terminal area
  - Ensure scroll inside board if content exceeds height (no overlap).
- Maintain the premium glassmorphism style.

4) TERMINAL DOCK LOGIC:
- Keep the bottom terminal dock ONLY for module click (existing behavior).
- Scenario click should NOT open bottom dock.

5) ANIMATIONS:
- Keep existing animations and style.
- Add subtle Framer Motion transitions for switching between normal mode <-> scenario mode:
  - fade + slide in grouped modules
  - inline scenario terminal fade in

DELIVERABLES:
- List all files modified.
- Provide the exact code changes.
- Ensure no regressions: category click shows correct skills; scenario click shows correct scenario skills; no overlapping; scenario plan is centered.
