Use my resume as the PRIMARY reference for Skills + Experience + Projects content. Do not invent experience. Use the exact tools, metrics, and project names from my resume. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Repo: Next.js (pages router) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Swiper.
Keep my existing animations and navigation behavior. Do NOT redesign motion styles—only adjust behavior + add resume-accurate content.

========================
A) SKILLS SECTION: PIPELINE ON SINGLE SCROLL (NO CONTINUOUS LOOP)
========================
Problem:
- Skills pipeline is continuously looping/auto-rotating.
I want:
- A one-time “teaser” movement when the Skills section first enters viewport, then STOP.
- After that, pipeline should stay stable until user manually drags/scrolls.

Requirements:
1) Remove/disable any auto-rotation/infinite animation (setInterval/autoplay/marquee).
2) When Skills section becomes visible the FIRST time:
   - Do a subtle horizontal “teaser slide” once (scrollLeft by ~80–140px smoothly OR a small translateX animation).
   - Then stop forever (no repeated loops).
   - Ensure the teaser triggers only once using a ref flag like hasTeased.current.
3) Keep user interaction:
   - Allow drag/scroll horizontally (desktop + mobile).
   - Clicking a skill still opens the existing skill detail UI.
4) Skills content must come from resume Technical Skills + Experience:
   - Languages: Python, Java, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, PowerShell
   - Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express, Spring Boot, Django, .NET Core
   - Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Redis (resume mentions Redis in Walmart bullet)
   - DevOps/Cloud: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Terraform, AWS, Azure, GCP, CI/CD
   - Tools: Git, Maven, JIRA, Postman, pgAdmin, JUnit, Mockito, OAuth 2.0, JWT, Spring Security
   - AI/ML: ChatGPT API, OpenAI, AWS Bedrock, NLP, PyTorch, TensorFlow
   Use proof badges per skill from resume metrics (99.8% uptime; 3.2s→1.6s; 2.5s→1.0s; etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

Pipeline layout update:
- Convert to TWO-LEVEL pipeline (2 rows) using resume categories:
  Row 1 (Platform/DevOps): Git → Jenkins (CI/CD) → Docker → Kubernetes → Terraform → AWS/Azure/GCP
  Row 2 (App/Data/AI): React/TypeScript → Node.js/Express → Spring Boot/.NET Core/Django → PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB/Redis → ChatGPT API/OpenAI → AWS Bedrock
- Keep click behavior unchanged.

========================
B) ABOUT/EXPERIENCE: ZIGZAG TIMELINE (LEFT/RIGHT) USING RESUME ONLY
========================
Goal:
- Replace About static content with a scroll-driven zigzag timeline:
  Item 1 appears RIGHT, item 2 LEFT, item 3 RIGHT.
- Each item should glow when it enters view (subtle red/orange glow).
- Use existing Framer Motion fade/slide variants; only apply them to each item.

Use these exact experiences and details from resume:
1) Walmart (Jan 2024–Present):
   - Java + Spring Boot + Kubernetes microservices, 99.8% uptime, 1,000+ daily users
   - React + TypeScript full-stack features
   - MySQL optimization + Redis caching (3.2s → 1.6s)
   - Jenkins + Docker CI/CD, hours → minutes, zero downtime
   - Spring Security, JWT, OAuth 2.0, 90% test coverage (JUnit)
2) Verizon (May 2023–Dec 2023):
   - React + TypeScript + Node.js (Express) + .NET Core
   - Modernized 3 legacy Python systems (300+ simultaneous users)
   - PostgreSQL optimization (40% improvement)
   - Pipelines handling 2TB/month
   - Docker microservices mentoring
3) Reddy Private Limited (Jan 2021–Oct 2021):
   - Django + React e-commerce, 500+ active users
   - PostgreSQL tuning (2.5s → 1.0s, 60%)
   - Spark + NumPy processing 5TB/month
   - DRF + JWT APIs, defect reduction 25%
All content must be resume-accurate. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

Implementation:
- Create/Update components/AboutTimeline.js
- Add a center vertical line + dots connecting items.
- Alternate alignment by index.
- Mobile collapses to one column.

========================
C) PROJECTS: RESUME PROJECTS + GITHUB REPOS + THUMBNAILS
========================
Goal:
- Work/Projects section should show projects that match BOTH:
  1) My resume projects:
     - Personal Appointment Scheduler (ChatGPT API + Google Calendar/Docs via GCP APIs)
     - CloudMart (OpenAI GPT + AWS Bedrock, multi-cloud AWS+GCP, CI/CD, logging/health checks)
  2) My GitHub repos (auto fetched)
- Every project card must include a direct GitHub link button.
- Keep current Swiper/ProjectCard animations unchanged.

Implementation:
1) Keep GitHub repo fetch integration (GitHub REST API), but ALSO pin the two resume projects at the top even if repo sorting changes.
2) Add tags/skills to each project using resume tech (ChatGPT API, GCP, OpenAI, Bedrock, CI/CD, etc.). :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Project images:
- Auto-generate attractive thumbnails by downloading GitHub OpenGraph images:
  Use: https://opengraph.githubassets.com/<any-string>/dubba1212/<repo>
- Create scripts/fetchRepoImages.mjs that downloads thumbnails into:
  public/projects/thumbnails/<repo>.png
- Add npm script: "fetch:thumbs": "node scripts/fetchRepoImages.mjs"
- ProjectCard should use local thumbnail if exists; fallback to remote OG URL; otherwise placeholder gradient.

========================
D) DO NOT BREAK THESE
========================
- Keep smooth scrolling and anchors working.
- Do not add continuous looping animations.
- Ensure no horizontal overflow / no bottom scrollbar.
- Modal close behavior remains correct (X, arrow, outside click, ESC).

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
- Implement A (single teaser + stop; two-level pipeline; resume-based skills/proofs)
- Implement B (zigzag timeline; resume-based experience content)
- Implement C (resume projects pinned + GitHub repos; thumbnails downloaded)
- List files changed and exact command to run thumbnails: npm run fetch:thumbs
- Confirm everything works on desktop + mobile.
