You are working in my Next.js (pages router) portfolio repo using TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Swiper. DO NOT change my existing animation style or navigation behavior—only add content + wire data.

========================
1) AUTO-POPULATE “WORK / PROJECTS” FROM MY GITHUB
========================
GitHub profile: https://github.com/dubba1212?tab=repositories  (repos include D_portfolio, CloudMart-A-Multi-Cloud-DevOps-Journey-with-AI-Enhancement, 2048-game, etc.)

Goal:
- The “My Work Portfolio” section should automatically pull my public repos and show them as project cards in the existing carousel.
- Each card must include a “GitHub” button linking to the repo’s html_url (direct link).
- Keep the same carousel animations/transitions already present.

Implementation:
A) Create a data fetch layer:
- Create lib/github.js that fetches repos from GitHub REST API:
  GET https://api.github.com/users/dubba1212/repos?per_page=100&sort=updated
  (Public endpoint; handle rate limits gracefully.)
- Also fetch README excerpt (optional) using the Contents API for description enrichment:
  GET https://api.github.com/repos/{owner}/{repo}/contents/README.md
- Use repo fields:
  - name
  - description
  - language
  - topics (if available; if not, infer from name/description/language)
  - updated_at
  - html_url (required for GitHub button)
  - homepage (optional for Live button if present)

B) Filtering rules:
- Prefer “original work” first:
  - deprioritize forks (repo.fork === true) and “forage-*” repos unless needed
  - but still allow them if you want a “Labs” category
- Pick top N repos by updated_at (e.g., 8–16) for “Featured”
- Provide a “View more on GitHub” link button to your profile.

C) Images:
- If repo has no thumbnail, generate consistent placeholders:
  - Use a gradient + repo name initials
  - Keep same card style/hover overlay behavior already implemented.

D) Integrate with existing carousel:
- Keep the current Swiper/Framer motion animations unchanged.
- Only replace the hardcoded projects array with the fetched repos data.
- Ensure cards show:
  - repo name
  - 1-line description (truncate)
  - tech chips (language + inferred tags)
  - buttons: GitHub (required), Live (only if homepage exists)

Docs reference:
- Use GitHub REST endpoints. (List repos & contents APIs.)

========================
2) SKILLS SECTION: ADD MORE SKILLS + TWO-LEVEL PIPELINE / ROTATION
========================
Goal:
- Keep the current Skills Playground look/animation.
- Add more skills relevant to Full-Stack + AI:
  Add at least: TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, CI/CD (Jenkins), Terraform, Redis, Azure/GCP, LLMs (ChatGPT API), AWS Bedrock.

Change:
- Convert the pipeline into TWO LEVELS (no side panel changes unless required):
  Row 1 (Platform/DevOps): Git, CI/CD (Jenkins), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, AWS/Azure/GCP
  Row 2 (App/Data/AI): React, TypeScript, Node.js, Spring Boot, Postgres/MySQL, Redis, LLMs/ChatGPT API, AWS Bedrock
- Alternate animation can be “rotational highlight”:
  every 3–5 seconds, smoothly highlight the next skill node (glow pulse), WITHOUT changing the click behavior.

Keep:
- Clicking a skill still opens the existing skill details UI (modal/glass overlay).
- Close must still work (X / arrow / outside click / ESC).

========================
3) ABOUT ME: SCROLL-DRIVEN “EXPERIENCE TIMELINE PIPELINE” (ALTERNATING LEFT/RIGHT)
========================
Goal:
- Replace the current About Me static content with a scroll-driven timeline:
  - As user scrolls down, Experience 1 animates in on the RIGHT with glow.
  - Scroll further, Experience 2 animates in on the LEFT with glow.
  - Experience 3 animates in on the RIGHT, etc.
- This should feel like a guided profile walkthrough.
- Use the same Framer Motion entrance style you already use (fade/slide), just applied to each timeline item.

Use my resume content (must be accurate):
- Walmart (Jan 2024–Present): Spring Boot + Kubernetes microservices, React/TS, performance improvements, CI/CD Jenkins+Docker, security (JWT/OAuth), Agile delivery.
- Verizon (May 2023–Dec 2023): React/TS + Node/Express + .NET Core, Postgres optimization, 2TB/month pipelines, Docker microservices mentoring.
- Reddy Private Limited (Jan 2021–Oct 2021): Django + React, Postgres tuning, Spark/NumPy 5TB/month workflows, DRF APIs, defect reduction.

Implementation details:
A) Create components/AboutTimeline.js:
- timeline list of experiences (3 items from resume)
- Each item renders as a glass card.
- Alternate alignment:
  - even index => right aligned
  - odd index => left aligned
B) Scroll behavior:
- Use whileInView / viewport triggers (Framer Motion) so items animate in as they enter view.
- Add “active glow” when in view:
  - subtle red/orange glow ring that intensifies briefly then settles.
C) Do NOT break global background or section padding.

========================
4) DO NOT CHANGE EXISTING NAV/SCROLLING/ANIMATIONS
========================
- Navigation clicking anchors must still scroll correctly.
- Keep current smooth scrolling.
- Do not rewrite the animation system—only reuse existing variants.
- Ensure overlays/background layers don’t block nav clicks (pointer-events none for background).

========================
DELIVERABLES
========================
- Implement GitHub-driven project population (with GitHub link button on every project).
- Implement two-level Skills pipeline + add additional skills.
- Implement About Timeline with alternating reveal + glow on scroll.
- List files changed and where to edit:
  - how to “pin” featured repos (optional)
  - how to rename project titles/descriptions if needed
- Confirm it works on desktop + mobile.
