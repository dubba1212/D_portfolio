Fix Skills pipeline animation + Projects swipe behavior + clean template wording/code, matching the previous “pipeline” feel shown in my screenshots.

Repo: Next.js (pages router) + TailwindCSS + Framer Motion + Swiper.
IMPORTANT: Keep existing animations and navigation behavior. Do NOT redesign the whole UI. Only restore the pipeline motion/feel, enable swipe drag for projects, and clean unused code/wording.

========================================================
A) SKILLS PLAYGROUND: RESTORE “PIPELINE FEEL” (ONE-TIME TEASER + STOP)
========================================================
CURRENT PROBLEM (from screenshots):
- Skills look like a static grid of icons.
- The previous “pipeline” feeling is missing (connected flow + motion/energy).
- The skill area feels dead/flat compared to previous pipeline version.

TARGET:
- Bring back the old premium “pipeline” vibe:
  - nodes aligned in a clean pipeline layout (two rows is OK)
  - subtle connector line(s) behind nodes
  - subtle energy flow animation along connectors
  - hover glow + soft scale
- One-time teaser movement when section enters viewport, then STOP forever (no loop).

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Remove internal/nested scrollbars in Skills:
   - No overflow-y scrolling inside the Skills container.
   - Only allow optional horizontal drag/scroll if needed (overflow-x-auto).
   - Hide horizontal scrollbar.

2) Build pipeline layout (two-level pipeline):
   Row 1 (DevOps/Infra): Git → Jenkins → Docker → Kubernetes → Terraform → AWS/Azure/GCP
   Row 2 (App/Data/AI): React/TS → Node/Express → Spring Boot → Postgres/MySQL → Redis → AI/LLM
   - Nodes should be evenly spaced and aligned like a pipeline, not a grid.

3) Add connector lines + “energy” flow:
   - Add an SVG or div-based connector line behind nodes.
   - Add a subtle animated gradient “energy bar” moving across the line (CSS keyframes).
   - Keep it premium (soft glow, 3–5s cycle).

4) One-time teaser motion:
   - When Skills section becomes visible FIRST time:
     - shift/slide pipeline slightly (like 60–120px) and then settle back (or scrollLeft).
   - Must run only once using a ref flag (hasTeased.current).

5) Interaction:
   - Hover: glow + scale
   - Click: keep existing click behavior (open existing skill modal/overlay).
   - Do not change the modal system here.

IMPLEMENTATION NOTES (do this exactly):
- In SkillsPlayground component:
  - remove setInterval/autoplay/marquee loop logic.
  - ensure skills wrapper uses:
    className="relative overflow-x-auto overflow-y-hidden no-scrollbar"
- Add CSS:

@keyframes pipelineFlow {
  0% { transform: translateX(-160px); opacity: 0; }
  20% { opacity: 1; }
  100% { transform: translateX(100vw); opacity: 0; }
}
.pipeline-energy { animation: pipelineFlow 4s linear infinite; }

- Add the energy bar behind nodes:
  <div className="absolute top-1/2 left-0 w-full h-[2px] bg-white/10">
    <div className="h-full w-40 bg-gradient-to-r from-transparent via-[#f13024] to-transparent pipeline-energy" />
  </div>

- Add teaser motion once:
  const hasTeased = useRef(false);
  useEffect(() => {
    const el = pipelineRef.current;
    if (!el) return;
    const obs = new IntersectionObserver(([entry]) => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting && !hasTeased.current) {
        el.scrollTo({ left: 90, behavior: "smooth" });
        setTimeout(() => el.scrollTo({ left: 0, behavior: "smooth" }), 650);
        hasTeased.current = true;
      }
    }, { threshold: 0.4 });
    obs.observe(el);
    return () => obs.disconnect();
  }, []);

DELIVERABLE:
- Skills section feels like a connected animated pipeline again.
- One-time teaser slide runs once, then stops.
- No nested vertical scrollbars.
- Hover glow/scale works; click still opens modal.

========================================================
B) PROJECTS: ENABLE MOUSE DRAG SWIPE (NO ARROW-ONLY UX)
========================================================
CURRENT PROBLEM (from screenshot):
- Projects titles show, but navigation feels like “button click only”.
- I want user to drag/swipe with mouse/trackpad to move to next slide once.

TARGET:
- Drag/swipe to move between project slides.
- Keep Swiper animations the same, just make swipe the primary control.
- Optional: keep arrows but not required.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Swiper must allow:
   - mouse drag (grabCursor)
   - trackpad swipe
   - mobile swipe
2) Remove dependence on arrows:
   - navigation arrows can be hidden or optional.
3) Smooth snap:
   - slide should snap into place, not free-scroll forever.

IMPLEMENTATION:
- Update Swiper config:
  grabCursor={true}
  navigation={false} (or keep but not required)
  pagination={{ clickable: true }}
  speed={650}
  slidesPerView={1}
  spaceBetween={18}

- If you want “slide once per drag”, enable:
  resistanceRatio={0.75}
  threshold={10}
  longSwipes={true}
  longSwipesRatio={0.2}
  followFinger={true}

DELIVERABLE:
- User can drag with mouse to move to next slide.
- Works on desktop/mobile.
- Existing look/animations remain.

========================================================
C) CLEANUP: REMOVE UNNECESSARY FILES, REQUESTS, AND TEMPLATE WORDING
========================================================
GOAL:
- Remove unused files, unused requests, unused code lines.
- Remove any wording that doesn’t reflect MY portfolio.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Identify unused components/files:
   - old slider components not used anymore
   - duplicate skills components
   - unused assets/images
   - unused api calls/hooks
   - unused CSS classes
   Remove them ONLY if they are not referenced anywhere.

2) Remove template/demo wording everywhere:
   - Search and delete/replace text like:
     "coming soon", "template", "demo", "sample", "example", "boilerplate"
   - Replace with portfolio-accurate text.

3) Keep project descriptions professional and real:
   - If any card says “The project is coming soon”, remove or replace with:
     “GitHub repository” or a real short description.

DELIVERABLE:
- Repo contains no dead code or unused files.
- No template/demo wording remains.
- Everything reads like Srikanth’s personal portfolio.

========================================================
FINAL OUTPUT CHECKLIST
========================================================
✅ Skills pipeline restored to animated “pipeline feel” (like earlier version)  
✅ Projects carousel supports mouse drag swipe to next slide  
✅ Unused files/code removed safely (no break)  
✅ All template/demo wording removed  
✅ No navigation/scroll/animation regressions  

Start by fixing SkillsPlayground layout/animation first, then Projects Swiper swipe behavior, then cleanup pass.
