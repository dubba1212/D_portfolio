My navigation scroll is working now, but ONLY the Home section has the correct background/theme. All other sections (About/Skills/Work/Contact etc.) lose the background and look blank/flat.

GOAL:
Apply the SAME global background, gradient theme, and decorative elements (bulb/circles / particles / lines if used) across ALL sections of my single-page portfolio, not just Home.

WHAT TO DO:
1) Find where the Home background is being applied.
   - Search for background classes, gradient divs, overlays, particles components, or decorative elements that exist only in the Home component.
   - Typical signs: bg-gradient, absolute background layers, Particles, background images, etc.

2) Create ONE global wrapper that applies theme to the entire page:
   - Wrap the entire page content (ALL sections) in a single layout container that includes:
     a) Background gradient / base color (same as Home)
     b) Any subtle animated background (particles/lines) if currently in Home
     c) Global decorative corner assets if used (bulb.png + circles.png) OR keep them section-based, but ensure the base background is global

   Example structure (conceptual):
   <div className="relative min-h-screen bg-[same-as-home] overflow-x-hidden">
     <GlobalBackgroundLayers />  // gradients + particles (pointer-events-none)
     <main className="relative z-10">
       {Home}
       {About}
       {Skills}
       {Work}
       {Testimonials}
       {Contact}
     </main>
   </div>

3) Ensure ALL sections have consistent section styling:
   - Each section should have:
     - className="relative overflow-hidden py-16 sm:py-20"
     - inner container width: max-w / container padding consistent
   - Ensure text colors are consistent (text-white/white/gray levels) and readable on the dark background.

4) Fix z-index and pointer events:
   - Background layers must be behind content:
     - pointer-events: none
     - z-index lower than content
   - Navbar/side nav must remain clickable:
     - ensure nav has higher z-index than backgrounds
   - Any new overlays must not block scrolling/clicking.

5) If each section currently has its own background color that overrides the global theme:
   - Remove section background overrides (like bg-white, bg-gray, etc.) unless intentionally needed.
   - Keep only transparent section backgrounds so the global background shows through.

6) Confirm after changes:
   - When scrolling from Home to About, the same background persists.
   - About/Skills/Work/Contact have the same global theme + decor.
   - No horizontal overflow (no bottom scrollbar).
   - Navigation anchors still work.

DELIVERABLE:
- Implement the global background wrapper and move Home-only background/decor layers into it.
- List files changed and where the global background now lives.

Start by locating the Home section/component and identify the exact background/decor elements applied there, then refactor them into a global wrapper around the whole page.
