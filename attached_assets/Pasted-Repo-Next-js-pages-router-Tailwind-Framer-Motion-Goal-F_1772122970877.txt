Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: Fix the Skills Playground layout so the bottom terminal NEVER overlaps scenario skills.

PROBLEM
- When a scenario is active, the center board shows grouped skills (Frontend/Backend/Infra/AI).
- The bottom black terminal (dock) appears and overlaps the center board, hiding some skill cards.
- I don’t want users to close terminal just to view skills.

TARGET UX
- The center board must ALWAYS show all required scenario skills fully visible.
- The terminal dock must appear BELOW the center board (stacked layout), not floating/overlapping.
- Keep existing animations and styles, only fix layout/structure.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
1) Find the Skills Playground section/component (SkillsPlayground / Skills section page).
2) Identify how the terminal dock is currently positioned (likely absolute/fixed inside the board wrapper).
3) Refactor layout to a stacked structure:
   - Top: Scenario selector pills
   - Middle: Skills content (left tabs + center board + right outputs)
   - Bottom: Terminal dock (rendered as a sibling below the skills content)

4) CSS/Tailwind rules:
   - Remove any absolute positioning of the terminal that places it over the board.
   - The terminal must be `relative` and appear under the board with margin/padding.
   - Ensure center board has enough min-height when scenario mode is active.
   - Make the full Skills section responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile).
   - Ensure no horizontal overflow. Keep background animations intact.

5) State behavior:
   - Do not change terminal logic or scenario logic beyond what is needed for layout.
   - Terminal can still open/close the same way, just render it below.

CHECKS
- In scenario mode, all skill cards should be clickable and not hidden.
- Terminal visible at the same time, no overlap.
- On smaller screens, terminal stacks below correctly and remains readable.

DELIVER
- Implement changes directly in the codebase.
- List files modified and what changed.
