Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: Improve GUIDED MODE so it is understandable + not trapping users. Keep the toggle.

CONTEXT (WHAT’S WRONG NOW):
- When I turn ON Guided Mode, it looks like it LOCKS categories and I don’t know what to do next.
- It feels broken because there’s no instruction/hint explaining the next step.
- I want Guided Mode to feel intentional, like a “System Simulation Mode”.

TARGET UX (MUST):
1) Add a small “?” icon next to the Guided Mode toggle.
- On click: open a compact tooltip / popover (NOT long) that explains in 3-5 bullets:
  - What Guided Mode does
  - What user should do next
  - How to exit/reset
- Must close when clicking outside or pressing Esc.

2) Guided Mode behavior rules:
- When Guided Mode turns ON:
  - Show a subtle “Step hint” text near the center board header:
    “Step 1: Select a System Node” -> “Step 2: Select a Module” -> “Step 3: Connect to an Output”
  - If your current implementation locks categories, make it clear WHY they are locked:
    - locked state should show a small label like “LOCKED — connect current module to proceed”
- Guided Mode should NEVER trap the user:
  - Provide a “Reset Guided Mode” small button/link near the toggle OR inside the help popover.
  - Reset should unlock all and clear guided progress.

3) Visual feedback:
- When in Guided Mode:
  - highlight the expected next action (subtle pulsing border/glow on the correct section)
  - example:
    - if no system node selected -> highlight System Nodes column
    - if node selected but no module selected -> highlight module cards in center
    - if module selected but no output chosen -> highlight Output Streams column
- Keep animations premium and subtle (no flashy).

4) Keep everything on the same page.
- No navigation.
- No full-page modal.
- Just popover + inline hints.

DELIVERABLES:
- List files modified
- Implement the “?” help popover + reset action + step hints + anti-trap logic
- Maintain existing styling (glassmorphism / neon red accents) + Framer Motion smoothness
