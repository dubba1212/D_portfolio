Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: Fix center-board layout spacing so the bottom “dock terminal” sits closer to the skills grid/cards, WITHOUT overlapping, and WITHOUT changing animations/behavior.

CONTEXT (current behavior)
- Scenarios + system modes + skill clicks all work correctly now.
- The ONLY issue: there is too much empty vertical space between the skills cards in the center board and the dock terminal (inside the center board area).
- When reduced, dock must still never overlap skills in any viewport.

TARGET
- Reduce the gap between the center skills area and the bottom dock terminal (make it feel tighter, premium).
- Keep scenario mode layout working: skills cards remain fully visible above dock.
- Keep system-mode skill selection working: terminal/dock still behaves like scenario mode (embedded within center board area).
- No horizontal overflow.

REQUIREMENTS
1) Center Board Layout
- The center board should behave like a “2-row layout”:
  - Top area = skills/cards grid
  - Bottom area = dock terminal
- Replace any “absolute bottom terminal” positioning (if used) with a stable layout approach:
  - Use CSS grid or flex column within the center board container.
  - Example: grid-rows-[1fr_auto] OR flex-col with justify-between.
- The dock terminal should be inside the board container and always anchored to the bottom section.

2) Spacing Rules
- Reduce the vertical gap:
  - The top skills/cards should end closer to the dock terminal (tightened padding/margins).
  - Use responsive spacing:
    - Desktop: small comfortable gap (ex: 12–20px)
    - Tablet/Mobile: slightly more breathing room (ex: 16–24px)
- Ensure the skills/cards area has “padding-bottom” equal to dock height only if needed, BUT avoid huge blank areas.

3) Prevent Overlap Always
- If the skill list becomes tall:
  - Make ONLY the skills area scrollable inside the board (NOT the whole page).
  - Dock terminal stays fixed inside the board bottom row.
- Use: overflow-y-auto on the skills grid container, and keep dock terminal overflow hidden.
- DO NOT let the dock cover cards.
- On small screens, dock can collapse slightly in height OR become “expand/collapse” (optional) but default must not overlap.

4) Files / Implementation
- Apply changes where the Skills Playground center board is built (likely a component like SkillsPlayground / SkillsSection / SkillBoard).
- Keep the same animations, transitions, colors, glow effects.
- Only adjust layout + spacing.

DELIVER
- Implement the fix.
- List files modified and briefly explain what was changed (layout approach + spacing values).
