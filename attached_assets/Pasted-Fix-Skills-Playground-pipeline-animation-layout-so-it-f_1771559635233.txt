Fix Skills Playground pipeline animation + layout so it feels like the previous premium pipeline, and update Experience section to a true zigzag left/right layout (keep existing experience animations).

========================
A) SKILLS PLAYGROUND: RESTORE “PIPELINE FEEL” + ONE-TIME TEASER (NO LOOP)
========================
CURRENT PROBLEM (from screenshots):
- Skills look like a static grid of icons.
- There are vertical scrollbars inside the skill area.
- It lost the premium pipeline vibe (connected stages, motion/flow).
- The animation feels worse than before.

TARGET:
- Bring back the old “pipeline” feel:
  - skills arranged in a pipeline / two-row pipeline
  - connected with subtle line(s)
  - hover glow + soft scale
  - premium easing transitions
- Do ONE small motion when section enters view, then STOP forever.
- No continuous looping / no autoplay.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Remove internal scrollbars from the Skills section:
   - DO NOT use nested vertical scrolling inside the skills area.
   - The page scroll must remain the only vertical scroll.
   - If horizontal overflow is needed, allow horizontal drag/scroll but HIDE its scrollbar.
   - Add "no-scrollbar" utility and use overflow-x-auto only.

2) Layout as 2-row pipeline with no nested vertical scroll:
   - Use a fixed 2-row grid layout (2 x N) OR flex-wrap layout that preserves the pipeline look.
   - Align nodes consistently (same spacing).
   - Use a connecting line layer behind nodes:
     - horizontal lines between nodes (or a subtle polyline)
     - line opacity ~0.25, red accent on active/hover

3) Add “flow” feeling (subtle):
   - Add a small animated gradient/dots moving along the connector line.
   - Keep it subtle and performant (CSS animation only).

4) One-time teaser movement:
   - When Skills section enters viewport first time:
     - animate the pipeline container horizontally by ~80–140px (scrollLeft) then stop.
   - Must run only once using a ref:
     hasTeased.current = true
   - After that, no further auto movement.
   - User can still manually drag horizontally if needed.

5) Interaction:
   - Hover: glow ring + slight scale + smooth easing
   - Click: open existing skill detail modal (keep your current modal UI)
   - Keep close behavior working (X, arrow, outside click, ESC)

IMPLEMENTATION HINT (do exactly):
- Create a horizontal container:
  <div ref={rowRef} className="relative overflow-x-auto overflow-y-hidden no-scrollbar cursor-grab select-none">
- Inside it render two rows:
  Row1 array + Row2 array
- Put connector lines as absolutely positioned behind nodes using an SVG overlay:
  <svg className="pointer-events-none absolute inset-0 z-0">...</svg>
- Nodes themselves are z-10.

IMPORTANT:
- Remove any code that created the internal vertical scrollbars you see in screenshot (it looks like you used overflow-y-auto on the skill container). Replace with overflow-y-hidden.

========================
B) EXPERIENCE SECTION: TRUE ZIGZAG RIGHT/LEFT
========================
You said the experience animation works fine, only alignment needs zigzag.

REQUIREMENTS:
1) Alternate alignment by index:
   - index 0 -> RIGHT aligned card
   - index 1 -> LEFT aligned card
   - index 2 -> RIGHT aligned card
2) Keep your existing Framer Motion reveal animations exactly as-is.
3) Add a center vertical timeline line + dots (if not already present).
4) On mobile: collapse to single-column (left aligned or centered).

Implementation:
- Wrap timeline in a 3-column grid:
  [left spacer] [center line] [right spacer]
- For each item:
  - If left item: render in left column
  - If right item: render in right column
- Keep the same card component and animation variants.

========================
DELIVERABLE
========================
- Skills section feels like a connected pipeline again (not a static grid).
- No internal scrollbars in Skills.
- One-time teaser motion triggers once, then stops.
- Experience section becomes true zigzag (right/left alternating) while keeping current animations.

Start by editing the SkillsPlayground component: remove overflow-y scroll, rebuild 2-row pipeline layout with connector lines, then adjust AboutTimeline alignment logic to alternate left/right columns.
