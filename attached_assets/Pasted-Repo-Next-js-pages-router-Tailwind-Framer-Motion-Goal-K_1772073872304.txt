Repo: Next.js (pages router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.
Goal: Keep GUIDED MODE unchanged. Only improve SCENARIO behavior.

DO NOT:
- Do not remove or change Guided Mode UI/state/logic.
- Do not refactor the entire skills section.
- Do not change existing animations except what is needed for scenario display.

CHANGES TO MAKE (ONLY THESE):

1) Scenario → show required skills inside the CENTER BOARD (middle space)
Currently, when I click a scenario (Build AI Chatbot / Build Microservices / etc.), the bottom terminal shows the scenario plan. Keep that.
But also render the scenario-required skills visually in the CENTER BOARD ABOVE the terminal.

Required layout inside the center board when a scenario is ACTIVE:
- Show 4 grouped lanes/cards (keep same style as existing skill cards):
  - FRONTEND
  - BACKEND
  - INFRASTRUCTURE
  - AI / LLM
- Each lane contains only the modules required for that scenario.
- Use the same existing module card UI (icon, label, glow/hover) but grouped.
- Animate in with Framer Motion: fade + slide + stagger (subtle, premium).

Implementation approach:
- Add a scenario config object (can be in the same file at first, no major refactor required):
  const SCENARIOS = {
    ai_chatbot: { label, modules: { frontend:[...], backend:[...], infra:[...], ai:[...] } },
    microservices: { ... },
    saas_dashboard: { ... },
    cicd_pipeline: { ... },
    data_pipeline: { ... },
    ai_search_rag: { ... }
  }

- The “center board” should render:
  IF activeScenarioId exists:
     renderScenarioBoard(SCENARIOS[activeScenarioId].modules)
  ELSE:
     renderNormalBoard() (whatever current behavior is)

Important:
- Clicking any module card inside the scenario board should still behave like normal module clicks:
  it should open the bottom terminal “module proof” content if that exists in your app already.

2) Scenario toggle/deselect behavior (double-click or second click)
Fix: If user clicks the same selected scenario again, it must deselect.
Behavior:
- If activeScenarioId === clickedScenarioId:
    set activeScenarioId to null
    close scenario mode view (center board returns to normal)
    hide/close the scenario terminal if it was open
- If clicking a different scenario:
    switch scenario and update center board + terminal accordingly.

3) State reset on scenario deselect
When scenario is cleared:
- activeScenarioId = null
- scenarioPlan data cleared
- terminal/dock should close OR return to default (choose whichever is already used in the app)
- selected module should be cleared ONLY if it was part of scenario mode
Goal: no leftover scenario text/cards after deselect.

DELIVER:
- Implement only these scenario-related changes.
- List the exact files modified.
- Mention where the center board rendering logic was updated.
