Goal: Fix the center board layout spacing so the top skills grid and bottom dock terminal have a tighter gap (less empty space), while ensuring NO overlap in any mode (Scenario mode + normal System Nodes mode).
Important: Keep the current “Skills Playground” design exactly (same UI style). Only adjust spacing/layout behavior.

CURRENT ISSUE

In the center board, there’s too much vertical gap between the skills cards area and the bottom dock terminal.

If we reduce spacing incorrectly, skills + dock might overlap in scenarios.

Normal System Nodes mode sometimes shows terminal in a different position/behavior than scenario mode — I want it consistent.

TARGET BEHAVIOR

Reduce vertical gap

Make the center board feel tighter and more “connected”.

The skills cards should sit closer to the dock terminal, visually.

But the dock terminal must still have breathing room and never cover skills.

No overlap guarantee

When dock is visible, the skills grid area must shrink or reflow automatically so cards remain fully visible.

Works for:

Scenario selected (scenario plan dock)

Normal clicking Frontend/Backend/Infra/AI module (module proof dock)

Guided mode dock (if it exists)

Dock must not cover cards; cards must not sit behind it.

Make terminal placement consistent

The dock terminal should always be inside the center board region (same placement rules).

Avoid the “terminal below the whole section” look.

Use the same docking system currently used in scenario mode as the standard for all modes.

IMPLEMENTATION REQUIREMENTS (do not redesign)

Keep the board container, background, glow, and style unchanged.

Adjust layout using:

a dedicated board wrapper layout (flex/column or grid)

a “content area” above the dock with a calculated min-height

padding-bottom on the content area equal to dock height (or dynamic measurement)

If using Tailwind:

Apply a consistent pb-[dockHeight] style (static or measured)

Reduce excessive gap, mt, mb, or unused spacing classes

Ensure dock height is stable and doesn’t jump layout.

ACCEPTANCE CHECK

Clicking any Scenario → skills show in center board → dock appears → skills remain visible (no overlap).

Clicking Frontend/Backend/Infra/AI → skills show → clicking a module opens dock → skills remain visible (no overlap).

Overall gap between skills area and dock is visibly reduced (tighter), but not cramped.
