I changed my portfolio so the background is global across the entire single-page. Now when I scroll, the bulb and circles appear repeatedly on each section/page because they are still rendered inside each section.

GOALS:
1) Keep the global background consistent across the whole single-page (I like it).
2) Remove duplicated bulb/circles from individual sections so they do NOT repeat while scrolling.
3) Keep bulb + circles as a single global decoration (render once only).
4) Make the background brighter / higher contrast than it is now (still premium, but not too dark).
5) Do not break navigation scroll, section anchors, animations, or overlays.

WHAT TO DO (step-by-step):
A) FIND duplicates:
- Search for where bulb.png and circles.png are imported/used.
  Keywords: "bulb.png", "circles.png", "Bulb", "Circles", "SectionCornerDecor", "DecorativeElements"
- They are currently placed inside multiple sections (About, Work, Contact, etc.). Remove those per-section usages.

B) CREATE/CONFIRM a single GLOBAL decor component:
- Create or use: components/GlobalCornerDecor.js (or DecorativeElements.js if already exists)
- Render bulb.png bottom-left and circles.png bottom-right ONLY ONCE at the page root wrapper.
- Must not create horizontal overflow:
  - wrapper uses overflow-x-hidden
  - decor container uses pointer-events-none
  - z-index behind content
- Keep them partially off-screen (half visible) like your style.

C) PLACE IT AT ROOT ONLY:
- In pages/index.js (or main layout), wrap all sections in a global container:
  <div className="relative min-h-screen overflow-x-hidden bg-[theme]">
    <GlobalBackgroundLayers />  // gradients/particles if used
    <GlobalCornerDecor />       // bulb + circles only once
    <main className="relative z-10"> ... all sections ... </main>
  </div>

D) REMOVE section-level clipping that hides the decor incorrectly:
- If any section has overflow-hidden and the decor is inside it, remove decor from that section.
- Keep overflow-hidden on sections only if needed for local animations, but global decor must be outside sections.

E) BRIGHTEN THE BACKGROUND (still premium):
- Increase brightness by adjusting the global background layers:
  1) Add a lighter radial gradient behind content:
     - Example: radial-gradient(circle at 35% 25%, rgba(255,255,255,0.08), transparent 55%)
  2) Slightly lighten base background color (purple) and reduce black overlay strength.
  3) Increase contrast for text:
     - Headings stay white
     - Body text use white/70-80 not too dim.
- If there is a dark overlay layer, reduce its opacity.

F) KEEP SCROLL & NAV WORKING:
- Ensure scroll is on html/body (no nested scroll container).
- Keep smooth scrolling enabled.
- Ensure background layers and decor are pointer-events:none so they never block clicks.

DELIVERABLE:
- Bulb/circles appear only once globally and do not repeat per section while scrolling.
- Global background remains consistent and is brighter than before.
- No horizontal scrollbar appears.
- Navigation scroll still works.

After changes, list the files modified and confirm where bulb/circles are now rendered (only at root).
